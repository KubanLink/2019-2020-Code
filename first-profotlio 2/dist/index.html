  About Me:
          I am 20 years of age And have always been in love with
          learning as much as I can. I am truly a book nerd, I
          enjoy running track and field for Riverside City College,
          and love to work with new poeple in creating Music.
          
          I have always been a hard worker and found Coding to be
          my favorite subjects out of my Major Studies.
